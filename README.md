-   Description: A Docker-based solution to run MOVES anywhere - on Windows, Mac, or Linux

## Welcome!

Welcome to `moves_anywhere`! This software suite includes several tools to help you run the Environmental Protection Agency's [MO]{.underline}tor [V]{.underline}ehicle [E]{.underline}missions [S]{.underline}imulator (MOVES) more easily. Developed by Tim Fraser and colleagues at Gao Labs at Cornell University, `moves_anywhere` aims to solve several common problems for planners, engineers, and researchers who need to know how many tons of emissions are produced from on-road transportation sources in their county or state. These problems include:

-   Writing `runspec.xml` documents faster (a recipe for your MOVES run)

-   Running MOVES on any OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux), using a Docker container.

-   Running MOVES with custom inputs when you have *some (or none)* of the required custom input tables, but not all.

-   Post-processing MOVES inventory output data into the more dataviz-friendly "CAT Format", developed for Cornell's Climate Action in Transportation (CAT) team's research.

-   Uploading CAT Formatted Data to a Google Cloud SQL server using a Docker container.

-   And more!

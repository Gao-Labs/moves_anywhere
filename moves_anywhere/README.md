# README `moves_anywhere:v2`

-   Description: This is the official README for MOVES Anywhere v2, designed to run MOVES 5.0.
-   Maintainer: Tim Fraser [tmf77\@cornell.edu](mailto:tmf77@cornell.edu){.email}

MOVES Anywhere is a program run on the docker image `tmf77/docker_moves:v2`.

Unlike `v1`, MOVES Anywhere `v2` has a base set of packages installed, and then uses mounted scripts, folders, and environmental variables to customize runs.
